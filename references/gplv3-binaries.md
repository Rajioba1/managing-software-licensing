- Section 6 allows conveying object code if you also provide Corresponding Source via one of the permitted methods.
- Permitted methods include: accompany with source; provide written offer valid at least 3 years and as long as you offer spare parts/support; or provide access from the same place at no extra charge.
- The offer is for anyone who possesses the object code, at no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution.

Use the official GPLv3 text for precise obligations.
