# OSI Approved Licenses

Source: https://opensource.org/licenses

- The Open Source Initiative (OSI) maintains a list of OSI-approved licenses.
- OSI approval indicates the license complies with the Open Source Definition.
- Use this list to confirm whether a license is OSI-approved before recommending it.

Tip:
- Many tools map SPDX IDs to OSI approval status; validate against the OSI list for certainty.
