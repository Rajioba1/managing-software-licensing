# GPL v2 (Binary Distribution Requirements)

Source: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html

- Section 3 allows distributing object code/executables only if you: (a) ship complete corresponding source, (b) provide a written offer valid at least 3 years to any third party at cost, or (c) pass along a received offer (noncommercial only).
- "Complete source code" includes all modules, interface definition files, and build/install scripts; excludes system components normally distributed with the OS unless shipped with the executable.
- If you distribute via a network location, offering equivalent access to source from the same place satisfies the source obligation.

Use the official GPLv2 text for precise obligations.
