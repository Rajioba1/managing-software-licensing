# Apache NOTICE Guidance

Source: https://infra.apache.org/licensing-howto.html

- Apache projects include guidance on when and how to use NOTICE files.
- NOTICE content is for attribution and informational purposes, not a license override.
- Downstream redistributors should include NOTICE text where required by the Apache-2.0 license.
- NOTICE should only include attributions relevant to the distributed work; avoid adding unrelated notices.

Use Apache’s licensing howto for official project guidance.
