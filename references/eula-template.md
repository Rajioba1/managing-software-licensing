## What is an EULA?

An **End-User License Agreement (EULA)** is a legal contract between a software developer/vendor and the end user that grants the user permission to use the software under specified conditions.

### When to Use an EULA

✅ **Use an EULA for:**
- Desktop applications (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Mobile apps (iOS, Android)
- Downloadable software, games, or industry-specific tools
- Software that requires installation on user devices
- Plug-ins, extensions, or add-ons

❌ **An EULA alone is usually not enough for:**
- SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) applications → Use **Terms of Service** (and a **Privacy Policy**)
- Web-based services → Use **Terms of Service** (and a **Privacy Policy**)
- Cloud-based platforms → Use a **SaaS Agreement** (often paired with a **Privacy Policy**)

**Exception:** If your SaaS includes a downloadable client (desktop or mobile), use an EULA for the client and Terms of Service for the web platform, with cross-references between them.

**Reference:** [What to Pick in SaaS: EULA, SLA or ToS](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/what-pick-saas-eula-sla-tos/), [EULA vs. Terms and Conditions](https://termly.io/resources/articles/eula-vs-terms-and-conditions/)

---

## EULA vs. Other Agreements

| Agreement Type | Purpose | Use Case |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| **EULA** | Grants license to use software | Desktop apps, mobile apps, downloaded software |
| **Terms of Service (ToS)** | Governs use of a service | Websites, SaaS, online stores, cloud platforms |
| **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** | Defines uptime, support, performance guarantees | Enterprise software, SaaS with availability commitments |
| **Privacy Policy** | Explains data collection/usage | Required by law (GDPR, CCPA) for data processing |

**Key Difference:** An EULA licenses **software** (code), while ToS governs **services** (access to a platform).

**Reference:** [The difference between an EULA and a SaaS Agreement](https://www.law365.co/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-a-eula-and-a-saas-agreement)

---

## EULA Acceptance Mechanisms

### Clickwrap (Recommended)

**Definition:** Users must affirmatively click "I Agree" or check a box before accessing the software.

**Enforceability:** Generally strong **when notice is clear and assent is unambiguous**. Enforceability depends on jurisdiction and presentation.

**Implementation:**
- Display EULA during installation or first launch
- Require user to scroll through the agreement or click "Read More"
- Present an "I Agree" button that must be clicked to proceed
- Optionally include a checkbox: "☑ I have read and agree to the EULA"
- Disable the "Install" or "Continue" button until the user accepts

**Legal Basis:** Electronic signature laws (e.g., UETA/E-SIGN in the U.S.) generally recognize electronic assent, but enforceability still turns on presentation and notice.

**Reference:** [How to Use Clickwrap for Your EULA](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/how-clickwrap-eula/), [Clickwrap Agreements and Legal Enforceability](https://www.upcounsel.com/clickwrap)

### Browsewrap (Not Recommended for EULAs)

**Definition:** Terms are linked on a webpage, and consent is implied by continued use.

**Enforceability:** Often weak unless notice is highly conspicuous and the user takes an action indicating assent.

**Why not for EULAs:** Software licenses require explicit consent. Browsewrap is better suited for website Terms of Service.

**Reference:** [Browsewrap vs. Clickwrap](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/browsewrap-clickwrap/)

### Shrinkwrap (Legacy, Physical Media)

**Definition:** Terms are printed inside a sealed software package. Opening the package constitutes acceptance.

**Enforceability:** Varies by jurisdiction; historically upheld in some contexts but less common today.

**Modern Use:** Rare; only for physical retail software.

**Reference:** [Shrinkwrap (contract law) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrinkwrap_(contract_law))

    interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the Software;

(b) DAMAGES EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE TWELVE (12)
    MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

THIS LIMITATION APPLIES EVEN IF [COMPANY NAME] HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION
OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY
NOT APPLY TO YOU.
```

**Cap Options:**
- **Paid software:** "damages shall not exceed the amount you paid for the Software"

---

### 9. **Termination**

```
7. TERMINATION

(a) Termination by User: You may terminate this Agreement at any time by
    uninstalling and destroying all copies of the Software in your possession.

(b) Termination by Company: [Company Name] may terminate this Agreement
    immediately if You breach any term of this Agreement.

(c) Effect of Termination: Upon termination:
    - Your license to use the Software will immediately cease;

    - Provisions that by their nature should survive (e.g., intellectual
      property, warranty disclaimer, limitation of liability, dispute
      resolution, and governing law) will survive termination.
```

**Best Practice:** Include a "cure period" for paid software: "You have 30 days to cure any breach before termination takes effect."

---

### 10. **Data Privacy and Collection**

```
8. DATA COLLECTION AND PRIVACY

(a) Data Collection: The Software may collect usage data, including but not
    limited to crash reports, performance metrics, and anonymized usage
    statistics.

(b) Personal Data: If the Software collects personal data, such data will be
    handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy, available at [URL].

(c) User Consent: Where required by law, we will obtain your consent for
    specific data processing activities. Your use of the Software is also
    subject to the Privacy Policy.

(d) Third-Party Analytics: The Software may use third-party analytics services
    (e.g., Google Analytics) that may collect data about your use of the
    Software.

(e) GDPR Compliance: If You are located in the European Economic Area (EEA),
    you may have rights to access, rectify, or delete your personal data.
    Contact us at [email] to exercise these rights.
```

**CRITICAL:** If your software collects personal data, you **MUST** have a separate Privacy Policy that complies with GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection laws.

**Reference:** [Understanding End User License Agreements (EULA)](https://www.sirion.ai/library/contract-management/end-user-license-agreement-eula/)

---

### 11. **Export Control and Compliance**

```
9. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS

The Software may be subject to export control laws and regulations (for
example, U.S. Export Administration Regulations, if applicable). You agree
that you will comply with all applicable export laws, including that:

    entity, or person prohibited by U.S. law or regulations;

(b) You are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident
    of any country to which exports are restricted or embargoed under
    applicable law;

(c) You are not listed on any applicable government list of prohibited or
    restricted parties; and

(d) You will not use the Software for any purposes prohibited by applicable
    law, including prohibited weapons or military end uses.

---

### 13. **Dispute Resolution (Arbitration)**

```
11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

(a) Informal Resolution: Before initiating arbitration or litigation, You
    agree to attempt to resolve any dispute informally by contacting us at
    [email]. We will attempt to resolve the dispute within 30 days.

(b) Binding Arbitration: If informal resolution fails, any dispute arising
    out of or related to this Agreement shall be resolved by binding
    arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).

(c) Arbitration Location: Arbitration shall take place in [City, State].

(d) Class Action Waiver: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED ON AN
    INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
    ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

(e) Exceptions: Either party may seek injunctive relief in court to protect
    intellectual property rights.
```

**Why Arbitration?**
- Faster and less expensive than litigation
- Confidential (proceedings are not public)
- Limits class action lawsuits

**Consumer Protection Note:** Some jurisdictions restrict mandatory arbitration clauses for consumers. Consider providing an opt-out mechanism and consult local counsel.

---

### 14. **Third-Party Software and Open Source**

```
12. THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS

(a) Third-Party Software: The Software may include third-party software
    components that are subject to separate license terms ("Third-Party
    Components"). A list of Third-Party Components and their licenses is
    available at [URL or in THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt].

(b) Open Source Software: Some Third-Party Components are licensed under
    open source licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL). Your use of such
    components is governed by the applicable open source license. A copy
    of each open source license is provided in [location].

(c) GPL/LGPL Notice (if applicable): If the Software includes components
    licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) or Lesser General
    Public License (LGPL), you will receive the source code or written offer
    required by the applicable license, as described in our third-party
    notices.
```

**CRITICAL:** If your software includes GPL/LGPL components, you **MUST** comply with copyleft obligations. See the managing-software-licensing skill for details.

**Reference:** See `skills/managing-software-licensing/SKILL.md` for open source compliance.

---

### 15. **Indemnification**

```
13. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless [Company Name], its
officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all
claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to:

(a) Your use or misuse of the Software;
(b) Your violation of this Agreement;
(c) Your violation of any third-party rights, including intellectual
    property rights;
(d) Your violation of any applicable laws or regulations.
```

**Why This Matters:** Protects the vendor from lawsuits resulting from the user's actions (e.g., user uses software to infringe copyright).

---

### 16. **Force Majeure**

```
14. FORCE MAJEURE

[Company Name] shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance
due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to:

(a) Acts of God (earthquakes, floods, fires);
(b) War, terrorism, or civil unrest;
(c) Government actions or regulations;
(d) Pandemic or epidemic;
(e) Cyberattacks, internet outages, or telecommunications failures;
(f) Labor disputes or strikes.
```

**Why This Matters:** Protects the vendor from liability during events beyond their control (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters).

---

### 17. **General Provisions (Boilerplate)**

```
15. GENERAL PROVISIONS

(a) Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between
    You and [Company Name] concerning the Software and supersedes all prior
    agreements and understandings, whether written or oral.

(b) Amendment: [Company Name] may update this Agreement from time to time. If
    we make material changes, we will notify You by [email/in-app notification].
    Where required by law, we will request your consent. If you do not agree,
    you must stop using the Software.

(c) Severability: If any provision of this Agreement is found to be
    unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated
    to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall
    remain in full force and effect.

(d) Waiver: No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further
    or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.

(e) Assignment: You may not assign or transfer this Agreement without
    [Company Name]'s prior written consent. [Company Name] may assign this
    Agreement without restriction.

(f) Independent Contractors: The parties are independent contractors. This
    Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, or agency
    relationship.

(g) Survival: Provisions that by their nature should survive termination
    (including intellectual property, warranty disclaimer, limitation of
    liability, dispute resolution, and governing law) shall survive.
```

**Best Practice:** The "severability" clause ensures that if one provision is invalidated, the rest of the EULA remains enforceable.

---

### 18. **Contact Information**

```
16. CONTACT INFORMATION

If you have any questions about this Agreement, please contact us at:

[Company Name]
[Address]
[City, State, ZIP]
[Country]
Email: [legal@company.com]
Phone: [Phone Number]
```

**Best Practice:** Provide a dedicated legal contact (e.g., `legal@company.com`) rather than a general support email.

---

## Regional Compliance Considerations

### European Union (GDPR & Digital Content Directive)

**Key Requirements:**
- **GDPR:** If processing personal data, you must have a separate Privacy Policy with legal basis, data retention, and user rights (access, rectification, deletion).
- **Digital Content Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/770, implemented in 2022):** Consumer rights to conformity and remedies cannot be waived. Blanket warranty disclaimers may be unenforceable for consumers.
- **Consumer Rights Directive:** Consumers generally have a 14-day right of withdrawal for digital content unless they expressly consent to immediate performance and acknowledge the loss of that right.

**Template Addition for EU:**
```
EU CONSUMER RIGHTS

If You are a consumer located in the European Union:

(a) Right of Withdrawal: You have the right to withdraw from this Agreement
    within 14 days of purchase without giving any reason. However, by
    downloading or using the Software, You expressly consent to immediate
    performance and acknowledge that You lose your right of withdrawal.

(b) Legal Warranty: EU law provides a legal guarantee covering defects that
    existed at the time of delivery. This guarantee cannot be excluded or
    limited by this Agreement.

(c) Data Protection: Your personal data will be processed in accordance with
    the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). See our Privacy Policy at [URL].
```

**Reference:** [Understanding End User License Agreements (EULA): EU Consumer Rights](https://www.hyperstart.com/blog/end-user-license-agreement/)

---

### California (CCPA/CPRA)

**Key Requirements:**
- Users have the right to know what personal data is collected
- Users have the right to delete their data
- Users have the right to opt-out of data sales

**Note:** CCPA/CPRA disclosures are typically provided in a standalone Privacy Policy; include a clear link from the EULA.

**Template Addition for California:**
```
CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT (CCPA)

If You are a California resident:

(a) Right to Know: You have the right to request disclosure of the personal
    information we collect, use, disclose, or sell.

(b) Right to Delete: You have the right to request deletion of your personal
    information, subject to certain exceptions.

(c) Right to Opt-Out: We do not sell your personal information. If this
    changes, we will update this Agreement and provide an opt-out mechanism.

(d) Non-Discrimination: We will not discriminate against You for exercising
    your CCPA rights.

To exercise these rights, contact us at [email or toll-free number].
```

**Reference:** [CCPA Compliance for Software](https://termly.io/resources/articles/what-is-eula/)

---

### Germany (Specific Requirements)

**Best Practice:** Present the EULA **before purchase** (not just during installation) to align with common German consumer contract expectations.

**Implementation:**
- Display the EULA on the product page or checkout page
- Require a checkbox: "☑ I have read and agree to the EULA [link]"
- Provide the full EULA text via a clearly visible link

**Reference:** [Understanding End User License Agreements (EULA): Germany](https://www.sirion.ai/library/contract-management/end-user-license-agreement-eula/)

---

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall | Consequence | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **No EULA presented before purchase** | May reduce enforceability in some jurisdictions (e.g., Germany) | Display EULA on product page with checkbox |
| **Vague license scope** | User confusion, potential overreach claims | Specify exact number of devices, users, or time period |
| **Missing GPL/LGPL attribution** | Open source license violation | Include THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt with all OSS licenses |
| **Blanket warranty disclaimer in EU** | Unenforceable under EU consumer law | Add specific EU consumer rights section |
| **No update mechanism** | Stuck with outdated terms | Include amendment clause with notification requirement |
| **Browsewrap acceptance** | Low enforceability | Use clickwrap ("I Agree" button) instead |
| **Missing governing law** | Jurisdiction disputes | Specify state/country law explicitly |
| **Class action waiver in California** | May be unenforceable | Consult CA-specific counsel; offer opt-out |

**Reference:** [Common EULA Mistakes](https://complydog.com/blog/complete-eula-guide-end-user-license-agreement-software-companies)
