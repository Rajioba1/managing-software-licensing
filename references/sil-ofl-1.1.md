# SIL Open Font License 1.1 (OFL)

Source: https://opensource.org/license/OFL-1.1

- The SIL Open Font License is designed specifically for fonts and related software.
- Allows use, modification, and redistribution of fonts in both source and binary form.
- Requires preserving copyright notices and license text when redistributing.
- Prohibits selling the font by itself (must be bundled with software or other works).
- Includes a Reserved Font Name mechanism allowing authors to restrict use of specific font names.
- Modified versions cannot use Reserved Font Names unless explicit permission is granted.
- Share-alike requirement: derivative fonts must remain under the OFL (not any other license).

Use the official SIL OFL 1.1 text for precise obligations and Reserved Font Name restrictions.
